The WEB GUI for [Spider3DSTools](https://github.com/dukesrg/Spider3DSTools) and more.
=====
Launching exploit on 3DS directly from that GUI might be unstable, in that case make a bookmark just after following the link but before browser hangs. On non-3DS devices you will get QR-code for the latest exploitable 3DS browser version.
